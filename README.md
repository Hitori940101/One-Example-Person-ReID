# [Progressive Learning for Person Re-Identification with One Example](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8607049)

Pytorch implementation for our paper [[Link]](https://yu-wu.net/pdf/TIP2019_One-Example-reID.pdf).
This code is based on the [Open-ReID](https://github.com/Cysu/open-reid) library and [Exploit-Unknown-Gradually](https://github.com/Yu-Wu/Exploit-Unknown-Gradually).

## Preparation
### Dependencies
- Python 3.6
- PyTorch (version >= 0.4.1)
- scikit-learn, metric-learn, tqdm

## Train

```shell
sh run.sh
```

Please set the `max_frames` smaller if your GPU memory is less than 11G.

## Performances

The performances varies according to random splits for initial labeled data. To reproduce the performances in our paper, please use the one-shot splits at `./examples/`
